In this project, we developed a simple Java-based console chatbot as part of the CodeAlpha internship. The chatbot uses a HashMap to store predefined question-response pairs. It interacts with the user through the terminal using Scanner, matches keywords from the userâ€™s input, and responds accordingly.

Key features implemented:

1.Used Java collections (HashMap) to manage keyword-response mapping.
2.Utilized a while loop and string matching logic to keep the chat running until the user types "bye".
3.Included responses for frequently asked topics like internship info, tasks, and contact details.
4.Applied basic string handling (e.g., toLowerCase(), trim()) for better input matching.
5.This project demonstrates the use of Java fundamentals such as loops, conditionals, string manipulation, input/output, and collections to build a functional text-based chatbot.
